### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**
### Match feature

#### Implementation

<img src="diagrams/MatchCommandDiagram.png" width="550" />

The match feature allows administrators to match mentors with students. It extends `Mentorface` with a functionality that connects a mentor and a student in a one-to-many relationship.

The match mechanism is facilitated by the `MatchCommand` class. It accepts two indices from the displayed person list and implements the following operation:

* `MatchCommand#execute()` — Matches a `Mentor` and a `Student` by setting the `mentor` attribute of the `Student` instance as the `Mentor` instance.

`MatchCommand` is used by the `MatchCommandParser` class, which helps to verify that the command is given in the correct format, i.e. with the correct arguments `m/` and `s/`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the matching mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs the command `match m/2 s/1` to match the second person in the address book, a mentor, with the first person, a student. The `MatchCommandParser` class verifies that the command is given in the correct format, i.e. with the correct arguments `m/` and `s/`.

Step 2. `Index` objects are created for the mentor and student in `MatchCommandParser` with values `2` and `1` respectively. A `MatchCommand` object is created with the two `Index` objects as arguments.

Step 3. The `mentor` and `student` attributes of `MatchCommand` are initialised with the two `Index` objects passed into the constructor in the previous step.

Step 4. `MatchCommand` calls `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`, which obtains the list of persons last shown in the address book.

Step 5. The two indices `mentor` and `student` are checked to see if they are valid. If they are not, a `CommandException` is thrown.

Step 6. If the two indices are valid, we obtain two `Person` objects, `mentorToMatch` and `studentToMatch`, based on the indices specified. We then check if `mentorToMatch` and `studentToMatch` are instances of `Mentor` and `Student` respectively. If they are not, an exception is thrown.

Step 7. The current mentor of `studentToMatch` is obtained using `Student#getMentor()`. If it is equal to `mentorToMatch`, an exception is thrown specifying that the two are already matched.

Step 8. We then obtain the centres of both `studentToMatch` and `mentorToMatch`. If these are not the same, an exception is thrown specifying that the two must be the same. If the two are the same but this is because both have their centres unassigned, we also throw an exception.

Step 9. We match the mentor and student by using `student#setMentor()`. We then update the `model` using `model#setPerson()` and `model.updateFilteredPersonList()`.

#### Design considerations
Note that the reference between mentor and student is only stored in the `Student` object to prevent circular dependencies. In order to retrieve the students that a mentor is matched with, it is necessary to iterate through the entire list of people and check whether each person is a student of the mentor in question.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user**: Peer tutoring NGOs such as Heartware Network

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Students from various institutions are deployed to tuition centres and schools across Singapore. Administrators struggle to track student and tutee information, making it hard to organise volunteers, monitor deployments, and identify understaffed schools. A proper system helps manage student details and ensure adequate support at beneficiary schools.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### Adding two different people with the same name
* **It is currently not possible to add two different people with the same name.** Currently, users would have to append a numerical suffix to differentiate them (e.g. `n/Lim Jun Jie 1` and `n/Lim Jun Jie 2`) and obtain their information later on using`findbyname Lim Jun Jie`. We plan to allow the user to add people with the same name by removing the duplicate name check and prompting them with a button should this situation occur, which they can click to agree to add the new person at their own risk.

* **It is currently not possible to include special characters in people's names**. Currently, users have to omit the part of the name containing the special character at their own discretion (e.g. Lim Jun Jie, Bala Krishnan) when adding them. We plan to allow some such characters to be part of a person's name, and enforce this using regex.
