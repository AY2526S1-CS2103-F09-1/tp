  Example usages include:

  * Enables NGOs to streamline their manpower allocation and management
* The project is built off a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) created by [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It has a **reasonably well-written** code base.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Mentorface` as a portmanteau of `Mentor` (referring to a trusted advisor) and `Interface` (the means by which someone can interact with a computer).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Mentorface Project Documentation](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/docs)**.
